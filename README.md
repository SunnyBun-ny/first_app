# first_app
Well this is the first app I have ever made with Flutter.

Basically it's a *Quiz app* with only 5 GK questions (Even I don't know answers to those questions. LOL). 
Each question has a 4 choices and is rewarded with 10 points if answered correctly. 
At the end, you get to see your final score and a phrase depending on your score. 
Also there's a button available below it to retake the quiz if user wants.
There's a Quit button provided in the upper right corner of the app incase user wants to close hte app.

    * Writing classes (private, constructors, named arguments, getter methods)
    * Learnt about Lists and Maps in Dart
    * Differnece between final, const & static
    * Anonymous functions
2) State of the app

3) Creating custom Widgets
4) Learnt various widgets and their propertis like

    * Container
    * Column
    * Text

5) Also did some research on colour palletes and designing UI of the application, found a app named Coolors which is pretty amazing for deciding colour palletes.

Looking forward to add more questions and UI to the app with more Widgets and options.
Also, a starting screen with main menu and a customized app icon.
